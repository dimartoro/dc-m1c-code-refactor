# Code Refactor Starter Code

# <Horiseon Website Optimized with Accessibility Standards for Search Engines>

## Description

Refactoring the code of the website of Horiseon's, a marketing company, to accomplish compliance with the Accessibility standards was the purpose of this project. The passing of time and dependency on technology switched the optional websites' access "for all"  to an enforceable requirement by law that involves companies' fines and marketing losses. It was enlightening to learn about the difficulties people with disabilities experiment trying to navigate a website and the advances in accessibility coding standards. It opened my mind and gave me the conscience of how far coding inclusive we should go. This project was essential and beautiful, and I hope to dive deep into it.

## Installation

1. Using git clone: Cloned without forking the started code located in https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/urban-octo-telegram.git to my local working folder.
2. Using git push: Pushed the started code under my local working folder to my remote new repo folder created in Git Hub. The critical detail learned was not  
   to select any "initialize this repository with" options to avoid conflicts when pushing an existing repository from my local computer to the remote repo.
3. When in sync, open my local working folder in VS.
4. In my new  working remote repo opened six issues according to user requirements.
5. I started correcting HTML & CSS code according to accessibility standards.
6. Using git checkout -b feature/add-xxxx, started creating branches to push separate changes.
7. Using git add -A, git commit -m, git push and git pull uploaded the different stages of changes from my local working folder to the three different branches in my remote repository.
8. Closed one by one the issues in my remote repo.
9. Created Read me file.
10. Review for last time my code.
11. Pushed changes to the last branch created.
12. Closed the last issue.
13. Deployment.
14. Submission.
